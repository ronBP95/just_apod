## **About the Project**

<br>

*just_Apod* as it stands, is a simple application with the main purpose of this project aimed at gaining experience working with Express and API's, which in this case, was the NASA Open API called "Astronomy Picture of the Day" or *APOD* for short. 

*Note*: The API is currently being called upon with a public key that is limited to 50 calls per hour. In order to increase the limit to 1000 calls/hour you will need to visit https://api.nasa.gov/ to sign up for an individual API key. 

<br>

Current Features:

<br>

- Media responsive Navbar with hover effects
- Currently pulling data from the NASA Open API (APOD) and updates imagery and descriptions daily

### **Built With**

<br>

I decided to go with building this application out with <u>**HTML**</u>, <u>**CSS**</u>, and <u>**Javascript**</u> for the frontend. For the back end framework I went with <u>**Express**</u>.

## **Roadmap**

<br>

1. Creating more views to display the about, contact and extra section
2. Connecting additional Open Api's from NASA and displaying them 
3. Creating a timer for the APOD view to display how long it will take for the next image to be loaded.
4. More ideas to come but these are my featured ideas.

## **Acknowledgments**

<br>

This is a special thanks to everyone who believes in me and my decision to switch to Software Engineering! I work as much as I can every day to make you all proud. I would also like to give thanks to NASA for providing the data that so many developers use globally.
